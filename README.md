NHLluck
=======

My brother asked how much each NHL game depends on luck. A good way to 
interpret "luck" in a sports setting is as the component of the W/L ratio
that cannot be removed by adjusting the skill within a league. In other 
words, the most lopsided game (best team vs worst team) should always
be won by the best team in a sport which has very little luck, and
should be split evenly in a completely lucky sport.

Results: NHL is not very lucky. The best team beats the worst team ~85%
of the time. Full pairings data inside.
